this was a for fun website made with html and css. my images folder was too big so not all images are included. may attempt to upload large file using the git client at another point in time. for now though, if you have seen the images page im sure you would get the gist of what i was going for. However, it does break the main page which is unfortunate. just imagine cool artwork anywhere there is something missing :)
